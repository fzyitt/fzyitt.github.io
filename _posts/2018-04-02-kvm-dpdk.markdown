# Using Openvswitch with dpdk in qemu-kvm
This wiki introduces how to configure qemu-kvm integrated in Openvswitch with and without DPDK.

## Setup requirements
* DPDK 17.05
* Openvswitch 2.8.2
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* qemu-system-x86_64 2.5.0
* VM image: xenial server cloud image
* **Network Interface Card**: Inter I219-V (which should be supported by DPDK)

## Configure Ubuntu cloud image

As the up to date version of Ubuntu cloud image, there is no default user and password. The only way to 
log into these kind of images is ssh with public keys shown in first boot logging. However the situation
is that i want to log into this without network pre-setting image in my terminal. Then the way is to change
cloud.cfg with guestfish.

``` shell
# install guestfish in ubuntu 16.04
sudo apt install libguestfs-tools
# open image filw with guestfish
guestfish --rw -a xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
# then inside guestfish terminal
><fs> run
><fs> list-filesystems
/dev/sda1: ext4
><fs> mount /dev/sda1
# after mount, edit cloud.cfg
vi /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
```

After getting inside image configuration file, remember to change these parameters:

``` shell
lock_passwd: True  --> lock_passwd: False
# add a line link below, the passwd can not be plain text, so it is generated with openssl as the plaintext 'secret'
passwdï¼š$1$SaltSalt$YhgRYajLPrYevs14poKBQ0
```

Then quit the guestfish, it is possible for us to login the image with username:ubuntu and passwd:secret
